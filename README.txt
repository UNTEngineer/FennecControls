FennecControls are a logical extension of the movement towards higher energy efficiency in homes and businesses.  My goals require that the system have a positive impact on the amount of energy used in homes and businesses, and that it eliminates or reduces the amount of energy wasted on unoccupied areas of a building.

These devices will be a combination of Open Source and Proprietary technologies to provide a cheaper alternative to Smart Management of your home.

The current project is a 1/3 scale prototype to demonstrate functionality and useability of the design.

Most libraries posted will be designed for use with FennecControls Devices. Some of the libraries can be used with any project. Follow my blog for updates at: http://tae09.blogspot.com

Git Clone and Git Pull can be easily used to keep the library up-to-date and manage changes.
